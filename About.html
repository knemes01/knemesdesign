				<p>Designer and Artist Kristen Nemes was born January 1995 in Providence, Rhode Island. She is a self-taught artist, though she hadn’t always been so inspired by the visual arts. Most of her childhood and adolescence focused on the fine arts of dance and theater. It wasn’t until January of 2014 that she had desired to become educated in the visual arts. In Fall of 2014, she transferred to Boston University School of Visual Arts and joined their undergraduate Graphic Design program. Later that year, she applied for the school’s 5-year Art Education Masters program alongside Graphic Design.</p>

				<p>For the pasted three years, Kristen has been studying, learning, and appreciating different medias and mediums of the arts. She has not only developed a love for design but for printmaking, photography, drawing, and painting as well. Additionally, she has been studying the principles and purposes of art education, applying her knowledge of the arts in preparation for a career in that field.</p>

				<p>Besides her love for art and teaching, Kristen enjoys spending her time dancing, acting, taking trips to Disney World, and playing with her leopard gecko, Endor. She hopes that the future holds great things for her and that she can someday show the world that there is more to art than meets the eye.</p>
