				<h3>About</h3>

				<div class="col-1-3"><br>

				<p>Born in 1995 in Providence, Rhode Island, Kristen Nemes is an emerging artist, designer, and teacher of this generation. Educated at Boston University School of Visual Arts, Nemes has absorbed the acute attention to form associated with many medias from painting and printmaking to photography and design. </p>
				
				<p><br>During her years of study, she has paid close attention to details concerning different medias and how they interact in the world of design. Often her studies in the visual arts education field influence her design tremendously. Nemes has recently been focusing on the education program STEAM, integrating it into her work as well as future education curriculums she plans to pilot. Find out more about <a href="http://steamedu.com">STEAM here.</a> </p>
				
				<p><br>She was introduced to the program during the summer of 2016 at an internship with Boston Childrenâ€™s Museum. Throughout the remainder of the year and 2017, her work has strongly been influenced by STEAM and the Maker Movement. From then on, close attention to materials, medias, and making were applied to her design work.</p>
